    <h1>Vechicle</h1>
    <p>     A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum[1]) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, <br>
            bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses, mobility scooters for disabled people), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, <br>
            boats, underwater vehicles), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicles, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, aerostats) and <br>
             spacecraft.[2]
            <br>
            <br>
             Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: <br>
              wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for  <br>
                road vehicles types, terms and definitions.[3]
